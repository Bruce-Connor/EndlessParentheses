<a href="https://github.com/Malabarba/aggressive-indent-mode/"><code>aggressive-indent</code></a> is quite something. I’ve only just released it and it seems
to have been very well received. As such, it’s only fair that I invest a bit more
time into it.
</p>

<p>
<a href="/permanent-auto-indentation.html">The original version</a> was really just a hack that was born as <a href="http://emacs.stackexchange.com/a/385/50">an answer on
Emacs.SE</a>. It worked phenomenally well on <code>emacs-lisp-mode</code> (to my delight), but
it lagged a bit on <code>c</code>-like modes.
</p>

<p>
The new version, which is already on Melpa, is much smarter and more optimised.
It should work quite well on any mode where automatic indentation makes sense
(python users, <a href="https://github.com/Malabarba/aggressive-indent-mode/issues/9">voice your suggestions</a>).
</p>

As a bonus, here’s a stupendous screencast, <a href="https://github.com/Malabarba/aggressive-indent-mode/pull/8">courtesy of Tu Do</a>!

Instructions are still the same! So long as you have Melpa configured, you can
install it with.

Then simply turn it on and you’ll <b>never</b> have unindented code again.

You can also turn it on locally with.
