<p>
One month ago, I <a href="/introducing-names-practical-namespaces-for-emacs-lisp.html">officially announced</a> <b>Names</b>, a package that writes your elisp
namespaces for you. Today, I go into other ways in which Names can help. Think of
these as delicious Easter eggs hidden inside the shabby wood cabin that is the
<code>define-namespace</code> macro (which is built on top of an underground Machiavellic
engine of infinite cogs and spikes, but that's beyond the point).
</p>

<p>
Names is about turning your code into an actual cohesive package, as opposed to
a collection of functions with a common goal. Since it knows everything about
your namespace, it can use that information to simplify your code. These
features are all implemented as keywords you can pass to the macro, and are
documented inside the <code>names--keyword-list</code> variable. 
</p>

<p>
As a practical example, take this simple snippet from <a href="https://github.com/Bruce-Connor/camcorder.el.git">camcorder.el</a>.
</p>
{% highlight cl %}
;;;###autoload
(define-namespace camcorder-
:package camcorder
:group emacs
:version "0.1"

(defcustom frame-parameters
  '((height . 20) (width . 65) (top .  80))
  "Parameters used on the recording frame.
See `make-frame'."
  :type '(alist :key-type symbol :value-type sexp))
)
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
The first two lines should be no surprise to you if you've read my <a href="/introducing-names-practical-namespaces-for-emacs-lisp.html">introduction
to Names</a>, but next three might. Those three tiny keywords are expressive and
easy to read, and save you a lot of code. The macro above expands to the
following.
</p>
{% highlight cl %}
(defgroup camcorder nil
  "Customization group for camcorder."
  :prefix "camcorder-"
  :group 'emacs)

(defconst camcorder-version "0.1"
  "Version of the camcorder package.")
(defun camcorder-version ()
  "Version of the camcorder package."
  (interactive)
  (message "camcorder version: 0.1")
  "0.1")

(defcustom frame-parameters
  '((height . 20) (width . 65) (top .  80))
  "Parameters used on the recording frame.
See `make-frame'."
  :type '(alist :key-type symbol :value-type sexp)
  :group 'camcorder)
{% endhighlight %}

<div id="outline-container-sec-1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-1">Package name</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
This just defines the name of the package, which is also the name of the group.
If you don't provide it, Names will calculate it by taking the namespace (here,
<code>camcorder-</code>) and removing the last character.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-2">Group definition</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
Most packages have a customization group. This leads to a bit of repetitive
code, as every single <code>defcustom</code> and <code>defface</code> needs to &#x2014;or should, at
least&#x2014; include the <code>:group GROUP-NAME</code> keyword. Names will spare you of that
chore, all you need to do is give it the <code>:group</code> keyword once, and tell it
which group is the parent of your package's <code>defgroup</code>.
</p>

<p>
The code above is specifying that Names should create a group for this package,
whose parent is the <code>emacs</code> group, and that every <code>defcustom</code> and <code>defface</code>
should belong to this group. 
</p>

<p>
If the automated~defgroup~ portrayed above is not to your liking, you can pass
a list instead of a symbol to the <code>:group</code> keyword. This list will be taken as
the entire <code>defgroup</code> form, sans the leading <code>defgroup</code>. Thus, you can define
your group however you want, and still benefit from the automatic childing of
variables and faces. 
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, Names is smart enough to not assign a <code>:group</code> to a variable that
already has one. So you can define additional groups in your package, and use
them as normal. Only the group-less variables (and faces) will be assigned to
the parent group.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-sec-3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-3">Version numbers</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
It is considered good practice by many for a package to define its version
number as both a constant and an interactive command. If you don't believe me,
see for yourself:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>hit <kbd>M-x</kbd>,
</li>
<li>type <code>-version</code>,
</li>
<li>hit <kbd>TAB</kbd>.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
By using the <code>:version</code> keyword, which is pretty self explanatory, you get a
constant and a command defined &#x2014;both named <code>PACKAGE-version</code>&#x2014; which return
the version you specify.
</p>

<hr  />

<p>
This concludes the most useful current keywords. The purpose of these
facilitators is not to write less code, writing is easy to automate. The
objective here is the same overarching goal behind Names itself, <i>making the
source code shorter to read and nicer to look at</i>.
</p>

<p>
To make use of the described features, make sure you require <code>(names
"20150000")</code> in your package. Also in the works are <a href="https://github.com/Bruce-Connor/names/issues/11"><code>:require</code> and <code>:use</code></a>, but
I'll let you know when these come out.
