<p>
Quick update to say that I’m quite pleased with the <a href="https://github.com/abo-abo/hydra">Hydra</a> package. Turns out
it’s not just eye-candy on top of keymaps, it also offers convenient
functionality that is rather dull to implement on plain keymaps.
</p>

<p>
If you use <a href="https://github.com/Malabarba/paradox">Paradox</a>, next time you upgrade you’ll find that a sneaky hydra has
made its way into it. It’s a very simple one under the <kbd>f</kbd> key, but it’s a nice
improvement over the plain keymap. 
</p>

<p>
Also, if you happen to follow the Emacs master branch, you’ll see that this new
hydra is actually not that simple and includes some filtering options that the
previous keymap didn’t even have. You have <a href="https://github.com/kaushalmodi/.emacs.d/blob/17e5cdc46e2e0a71070bf63e98be2ba727d1a579/setup-files/setup-paradox.el#L21-L41">Kaushal Modi</a> to thank for this.
</p>

<p>
If you’re the kind of person who hates mythical creatures, you can revert to the
plain keymap with this snippet.
