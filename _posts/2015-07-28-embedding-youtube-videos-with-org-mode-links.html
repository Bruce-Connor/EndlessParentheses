If you’re a frequent reader, no doubt you noticed an embedded Youtube video on a
post <a href="/debugger-improvements-in-cider-0-10-0.html">a couple of weeks ago</a>. Youtube makes it pretty simple to embed videos, they
give you the entire <code>iframe</code> HTML code to use, but this wouldn’t really be Emacs
if we couldn’t make things just a little bit easier. Just add the snippet below
to your init file, and you’re good to go.
</p>

{% highlight cl %}
(defvar yt-iframe-format
  ;; You may want to change your width and height.
  (concat "<iframe width=\"440\""
          " height=\"335\""
          " src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/%s\""
          " frameborder=\"0\""
          " allowfullscreen>%s</iframe>"))

(org-add-link-type
 "yt"
 (lambda (handle)
   (browse-url
    (concat "https://www.youtube.com/embed/"
            handle)))
 (lambda (path desc backend)
   (cl-case backend
     (html (format yt-iframe-format
                   path (or desc "")))
     (latex (format "\href{{"{%"}}s}{{"{%"}}s}"
                    path (or desc "video"))))))
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
To use this, just write your org links in the following way (optionally adding a description).
</p>
{% highlight text %}
[[yt:A3JAlWM8qRM]]
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
When you export to HTML, this will produce that same inlined snippet that
Youtube specifies. The advantage (over simply writing out the <code>iframe</code>) is that
this link can be clicked in <code>org-mode</code>, and can be exported to other formats as
well.
