<p>
Now that you’ve started your journey on the Typography Express by <a href="/prettify-your-quotation-marks.html">using round
double quotes</a>, take a seat and extend that to your apostrophes as well. This
snippet binds a round apostrophe to the <kbd>'</kbd> key, but also inserts a pair of
single round quotes with a prefix.
</p>

<p>
Finally, like the previous one, it also falls back on <a href="https://doc.endlessparentheses.com/Fun/self-insert-command"><code>self-insert-command</code></a>
inside a code block.
