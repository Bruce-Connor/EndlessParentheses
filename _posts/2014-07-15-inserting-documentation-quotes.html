Hopefully I'm not the only one who obsessively tries to abide by the
high codes of good practice and writes descriptive documentation on
every last <a href="http://bruce-connor.github.io/emacs-online-documentation/Fun/defun"><code>defun</code></a> or <a href="http://bruce-connor.github.io/emacs-online-documentation/Fun/defcustom"><code>defcustom</code></a>. If so, I can't be the only one who
has grown tired of typing ` then ' inside Emacs doc strings.
</p>
{% highlight cl %}
(define-key emacs-lisp-mode-map "\C-cm" "`'\C-b")
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
The <kbd>m</kbd> key feels natural to me here, because I also
use <kbd>C-c m</kbd> in LaTeX for quoting math, but you might
find some other key more intuitive.
