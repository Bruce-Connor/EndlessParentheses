My <a href="/ispell-and-abbrev-the-perfect-auto-correct.html">Emacs auto-correct</a> is one of the oldest posts on this blog, and I still see
it pop up here and there on occasion. Last week, Norman Ramsey <a href="/ispell-and-abbrev-the-perfect-auto-correct.html#comment-2440958792">asked</a> about an
improvement to that command and I figured itâ€™s worth an update post.

As of today, the code in the post will search backwards for a typo, instead of
just correcting the current word. So you can invoke it without trouble even if
the typo happened several words ago.</p>
