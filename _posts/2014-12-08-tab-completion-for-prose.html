<p>
When writing prose, I find auto-completion to be more of a distraction
then an aid. However, my field of research involves much
repetition of some annoyingly long words, such as <i>“thermalization”</i> or
<i>“distinguishability”</i>.
</p>

<p>
Instead of completely disabling auto-complete, I've found it useful to dial it
down a notch, while still letting it trigger on these monstrosities.
</p>
{% highlight cl %}
(setq ac-auto-start 3)
(setq company-minimum-prefix-length 3)

(defun endless/config-prose-completion ()
  "Make auto-complete less agressive in this buffer."
  (setq-local company-minimum-prefix-length 6)
  (setq-local ac-auto-start 6))

(add-hook 'text-mode-hook
  #'endless/config-prose-completion)
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
This will offer completions based on previously typed text, but only when I
stumble while typing a long word.
</p>

<p>
Do you use any kind of tab completion for writing prose? It seems
<code>company-mode</code> has an Ispell back-end, has anyone ever tried that?</p>
