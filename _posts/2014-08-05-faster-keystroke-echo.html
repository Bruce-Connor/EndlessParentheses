My laptop is old it is almost getting out-performed by my smartphone.
The principal consequence being that the keyboard has started to give
up on life. Occasionally, a key won't register when I hit it, and
occasionally I'll get paranoid and hit a key twice without knowing it
actually had registered the first time.

Emacs' keystroke echoing is a fantastic aid in this regard, informing
me whether the key worked or not. I only need to make it faster so
that I don't have to wait for it.
