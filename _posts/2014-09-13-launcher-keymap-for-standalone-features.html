<p>
Following on our series of mnemonic keymaps, we arrive on the
<b>launcher-map</b>. Where the <a href="/the-toggle-map-and-wizardry.html">toggle-map</a> was designed for toggling values
and minor-modes we only use every once in a while, the launcher-map
runs those <i>“standalone”</i> features of Emacs that also don't always see
the light of day.
</p>

<p>
To remember the keybinds, think of <i>“Emacs launch calc”</i> for instance.

{% highlight cl %}
(define-prefix-command 'launcher-map)
;; The manual recommends C-c for user keys, but C-x l is
;; always free and is natural to remember.
(define-key ctl-x-map "l" 'launcher-map)
(global-set-key (kbd "s-l") 'launcher-map)
(define-key launcher-map "c" #'calc)
(define-key launcher-map "d" #'ediff-buffers)
(define-key launcher-map "f" #'find-dired)
(define-key launcher-map "g" #'lgrep)
(define-key launcher-map "G" #'rgrep)
(define-key launcher-map "h" #'man) ; Help
(define-key launcher-map "i" #'package-install-from-buffer)
(define-key launcher-map "n" #'nethack)
(define-key launcher-map "p" #'paradox-list-packages)
(define-key launcher-map "s" #'shell)
(define-key launcher-map "t" #'proced) ; top
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
<code>calc</code>, <code>man</code>, <code>list-packages</code>&#x2026; I use these features, on average,
once or twice every other moon. An intuitive keymap is exactly what I
need to always remember their keybinds.
