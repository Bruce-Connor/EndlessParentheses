I love intuitive keymaps. Some are so perfect, you just can't avoid
mouthing the words every time you hit that blissful combo. A wizard
murmuring an incantation under his breath as his fingers draw the
arcane patterns.
</p>

<p>
Here's a keymap that toggles some options which tend to be useful
throughout a session.
</p>
{% highlight cl %}
(define-prefix-command 'toggle-map)
(define-key ctl-x-map "t"  #'toggle-map)
(define-key toggle-map "c" 'column-number-mode)
(define-key toggle-map "d" 'toggle-debug-on-error)
(define-key toggle-map "e" 'toggle-debug-on-error)
(define-key toggle-map "f" 'auto-fill-mode)
(define-key toggle-map "l" 'toggle-truncate-lines)
(define-key toggle-map "q" 'toggle-debug-on-quit)
(define-key toggle-map "r" 'read-only-mode)
(define-key toggle-map "t" 'tt/toggle-theme)
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
There are eight keys being defined there, most of which aren't even
used every day, but I know I'll never forget a single one. That is the
beauty of intuitiveness. 
</p>

<p>
Doesn't <i>"Emacs toggle column"</i> just roll off your tongue as you're
typing <kbd>C-x t c</kbd>? I feel like I'm commanding the
strands of reality, but that could just be my D&amp;D past taking the
better of me.</p>
