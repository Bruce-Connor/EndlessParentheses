Have you ever stopped to think about why isearch leaves point at the end of the
match? It does make some intuitive sense to leave you after the characters you
have just typed, but that doesn’t make it the most practical behaviour.
</p>

<p>
This is something I’d never even given half a thought in the past, but it’s one
of the first things a friend questioned me as he was diving into Emacs (yes, the
same one as <a href="/a-small-improvement-to-clj-refactor.html">last week</a>). Why not leave the cursor at the start of the match,
instead of the end?
</p>

<p>
It’s great when someone’s fresh perspective shakes new ideas into my
gradually-calcifying init file, so I immediately started looking for a way to do
this. Fortunately, Google was quick to find me an answer, in <a href="https://github.com/thisirs/dotemacs/blob/master/lisp/init-isearch.el#L1">the dotfiles</a> of one
Sylvain Rousseau. I should go through the entire file later to look for more
snippets, but for the current purpose, the following is all we need.
</p>
{% highlight cl %}
(add-hook 'isearch-mode-end-hook
          #'endless/goto-match-beginning)
(defun endless/goto-match-beginning ()
  "Go to the start of current isearch match.
Use in `isearch-mode-end-hook'."
  (when (and isearch-forward
             (number-or-marker-p isearch-other-end)
             (not mark-active)
             (not isearch-mode-end-hook-quit))
    (goto-char isearch-other-end)))
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
After using this for a few days, I’ve already ran into a couple of cases where I
would have preferred the original behaviour. Still, the net balance has been
positive so far so it’s probably going to stay.
