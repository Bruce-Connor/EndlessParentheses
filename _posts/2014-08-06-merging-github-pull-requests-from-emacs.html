Last week, Bin Chen shared his workflow for <a href="http://blog.binchen.org/posts/how-to-accept-the-github-pull-request-efficiently.html">merging Github pull
requests</a>. Other than the use of Firefox instead of Conkeror, it was
identical to mine. Now I gladly come to admit that <a href="https://github.com/alexander-yakushev">Alexander Yakushev</a>
has outsmarted us both by fixing up <a href="https://github.com/sigma/magit-gh-pulls">magit-gh-pulls-mode</a>, a package
originally written by <a href="https://github.com/sigma">Yann Hodique</a> which does it all from within
Magit.
</p>

<p>
You can find the keybinds on the <a href="https://github.com/sigma/magit-gh-pulls#usage">Readme</a> page.
</p>

<p>
It bothers me very slightly that it immediately queries for
pull-requests when I first call <code>magit-status</code>, even if I’m not
interested in pull-requests at the moment. So we change the suggested
setup in order to fix that.
</p>
{% highlight cl %}
(when (fboundp 'magit-gh-pulls-mode)
  (eval-after-load 'magit
    '(define-key magit-mode-map "#gg"
       #'endless/load-gh-pulls-mode))

  (defun endless/load-gh-pulls-mode ()
    "Start `magit-gh-pulls-mode' only after a manual request."
    (interactive)
    (require 'magit-gh-pulls)
    (add-hook 'magit-mode-hook #'turn-on-magit-gh-pulls)
    (magit-gh-pulls-mode 1)
    (magit-gh-pulls-reload)))
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
With this setup it’ll only activate <code>magit-gh-pulls-mode</code> after you
try to update the list of pull-requests.
