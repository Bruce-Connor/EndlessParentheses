It was a few years ago that I learned about <a href="https://github.com/winterTTr/ace-jump-mode"><code>ace-jump-mode</code></a> in one of Magnar’s
<a href="http://emacsrocks.com/e10.html">Emacs Rocks</a> episodes. Over this time, slowly but surely, this one simple command
has completely taken over my workflow. It was only last week that I realised how
ingrained it is on my muscle memory. As I <a href="https://twitter.com/AMalabarba/status/594575241638182912">shared this thought</a> on twitter,
<a href="http://twitter.com/_abo_abo">@_abo_abo</a>’s <a href="https://github.com/abo-abo/avy"><code>avy</code></a> was mentioned in the conversation and I decided to give it a
try.
</p>

<p>
Until now, I was under the impression that it was just <code>ace-jump</code> for windows,
but it’s a little more than that. It is actually a full replacement for
<code>ace-jump</code>, with small improvements here and there (plus quite a bit of parallel
functionality which I haven’t explored yet).
</p>

<p>
A couple of small but important differences.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>By default, the buffer text doesn’t get shadowed while you’re doing a jump. I
didn’t like this at first, but now I much prefer it. Shadowing the text is
prettier, but I would commonly get lost if I didn’t focus intently on that
letter before the shadowing was applied.
</li>
<li>When more than one key is needed for a jump, it’ll show you the full path,
instead of one key at a time.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
And this is all the configuration I needed.
