<p>
If you’ve every tried to do some spell-checking in <code>org-mode</code> you know how
finicky that can be. Ispell is happy to check absolutely anything, even code
blocks and property drawers! When you’re blogging about code-snippets from an
org file this annoyance quickly turns into irritation. Here’s how you fix it.

{% highlight cl %}
(defun endless/org-ispell ()
  "Configure `ispell-skip-region-alist' for `org-mode'."
  (make-local-variable 'ispell-skip-region-alist)
  (add-to-list 'ispell-skip-region-alist '(org-property-drawer-re))
  (add-to-list 'ispell-skip-region-alist '("~" "~"))
  (add-to-list 'ispell-skip-region-alist '("=" "="))
  (add-to-list 'ispell-skip-region-alist '("^#\\+BEGIN_SRC" . "^#\\+END_SRC")))
(add-hook 'org-mode-hook #'endless/org-ispell)
{% endhighlight %}
