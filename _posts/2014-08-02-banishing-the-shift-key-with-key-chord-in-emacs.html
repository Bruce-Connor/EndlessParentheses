<p>
Take a minute now and be honest with yourself. Do you like the shift
key, or do you just put up with it? Perhaps it's just because my hands
are the size of basketballs, but I've always found the
<kbd>Shift</kbd> key hard to reach.

<p>
<a href="http://emacsrocks.com/e07.html">Keychord</a> has allowed me to ban my shift use at least when it comes to
inputting symbols.

{% highlight cl %}
(key-chord-define-global "0o" ")")
;; Sadly, "1q" is impossible to hit on my keyboard.
(key-chord-define-global "1q" "!")
(key-chord-define-global "2w" "@")
(key-chord-define-global "3e" "#")
(key-chord-define-global "4r" "$")
(key-chord-define-global "5t" "%")
(key-chord-define-global "7y" "&")
(key-chord-define-global "8u" "*")
(key-chord-define-global "9i" "(")
(key-chord-define-global "-p" "_")

(key-chord-define emacs-lisp-mode-map
                  "7y" "&optional ")

(key-chord-mode 1)
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
Anyone know of a way to get rid of shift for capitalization?</p>
