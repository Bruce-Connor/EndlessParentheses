<p>
<code>show-paren-mode</code> is a minor-mode that highlights the bracket at point (be it
round, square, or curly) as well as its corresponding open/close counterpart. I
find it a must-have for Elisp and Clojure programming. On the other hand, when
editing Ruby code, it also highlights whole block delimiters, like <code>def</code>, <code>do</code>,
<code>if</code>, and <code>end</code>, and all that must-haviness quickly turns into
in-your-faceviness.
</p>

<p>
The catch here is that <code>show-paren-mode</code> is a global minor-mode. So you can’t
just enable it locally in <code>lisp-mode-hook</code>, and if you try to do
<code>(show-paren-mode -1)</code> in <code>ruby-mode-hook</code> you’re going to disable it globally
every time you visit a ruby file.
</p>

<p>
Fortunately, <code>show-paren-function</code> checks the value of the variable
<code>show-paren-mode</code>, so we can pseudo-disable it by setting this variable locally.
</p>
{% highlight cl %}
(show-paren-mode 1)

(defun endless/locally-disable-show-paren ()
  (interactive)
  (setq-local show-paren-mode nil))

(add-hook 'ruby-mode-hook
          #'endless/locally-disable-show-paren)
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
With this, the mode will still be active in <code>ruby-mode</code> buffers, but it won’t
actually do anything.
</p>

<p>
Alternatively, you could reset <code>show-paren-data-function</code> to its original value
(also inside <code>ruby-mode-hook</code>). This will keep only the basic bracket
highlighting.
</p>
{% highlight cl %}
(setq-local show-paren-data-function #'show-paren--default)
{% endhighlight %}
