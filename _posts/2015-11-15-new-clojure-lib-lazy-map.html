<p>
The concept of a <a href="https://github.com/Malabarba/lazy-map-clojure#the-lazy-map">lazy-map</a> might sounds odd at first. How do you know if a map
contains an entry without resolving the whole map? But it’s not the entries that
are lazy, it’s the values they hold. See this example from the Readme:
</p>

{% highlight clojure %}
user> (def my-map
        (lazy-map {:cause (do (println "Getting Cause")
                              :major-failure)
                   :name (do (println "Getting Name")
                             "Some Name")}))
#'user/my-map

user> (:name my-map)
Getting Name
"Some Name"

user> (:name my-map)
"Some Name"

user> (:cause my-map)
Getting Cause
:major-failure
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
<a href="https://github.com/Malabarba/lazy-map-clojure#the-lazy-map">Lazy-map</a> is on Clojars, so you can just add it as a dep and play around:

One of my side projects a few months ago (when I was playing around with
Clojure-on-Android) was an Android client for a desktop Java application.
Because of this, a lot of the code was about interfacing with Java objects
defined by this package.  These objects were from many different classes, but
the one thing they had in common is that they were full of <code>get</code> methods.
</p>

<p>
I wanted so much to be able to use these objects as maps that I wrote <a href="https://github.com/Malabarba/lazy-map-clojure#the-to-lazy-map-protocol">a protocol</a>
for converting general objects to Clojure maps. Here’s an example of how it
worked on a string.
</p>
{% highlight clojure %}
user> (to-map "My own String!")
{:to-char-array #object["[C" 0xdf4ddb3 "[C@df4ddb3"],
 :empty? false,
 :to-string "My own String!",
 :chars #object[java.util.stream.IntPipeline$Head 0xad35343 "java.util.stream.IntPipeline$Head@ad35343"],
 :class java.lang.String,
 :length 14,
 :trim "My own String!",
 :bytes #object["[B" 0x75ef7d8f "[B@75ef7d8f"],
 :hash-code 1673659170,
 :object "My own String!",
 :to-upper-case "MY OWN STRING!"}
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
For comparison, here’s how <code>bean</code> works (a similar function from
<code>clojure.core</code>).
</p>
{% highlight clojure %}
user> (bean "My own String!")
{:bytes #object["[B" 0x1ad60072 "[B@1ad60072"],
 :class java.lang.String,
 :empty false}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
The protocol is actually quite smart. It uses a number of heuristics to only
convert methods that look like they’re side-effect free. Of course, it’s not
foolproof (this <i>is</i> Java we’re talking about), but the macro used to extend the
protocol lets you specify methods to exclude.
</p>

<p>
The only problem was the performance cost. Some of these methods were very
expensive to run, and eagerly calling all methods of all objects just so I could
later access some of these was obviously a bad deal. The solution, clearly, was
to only call these methods when the map entries were actually accessed. And so
<code>lazy-map</code> was born.
