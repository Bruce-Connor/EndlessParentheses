<p>
I’ve never been too pleased with the default behaviour of <kbd>Backspace</kbd> during
<code>isearch</code>. If the last key you hit was <kbd>C-s</kbd>, then it does the same as <kbd>C-r</kbd>
(albeit with less repetition), and if your match failed several characters ago,
you need to hit it that many times to get back on track. Fortunately, <a href="http://emacs.stackexchange.com/users/118/asmeurer">asmeurer</a>
took the time to <a href="http://emacs.stackexchange.com/q/10359/50">phrase this problem</a> I barely realised I had.
</p>

<p>
In response, <a href="http://emacs.stackexchange.com/users/105/drew">Drew</a> provides a command to:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>delete the entire portion of <code>isearch</code> string that doesn’t match,
</li>
<li>if everything matches, fallback on deleting last char instead of moving backwards.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
I’ll let you follow <a href="http://emacs.stackexchange.com/q/10359/50">the link</a> for the code, but I’ll say I had to use a different
keybind for it to work.
