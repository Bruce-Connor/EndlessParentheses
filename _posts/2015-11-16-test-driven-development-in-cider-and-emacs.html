As I was catching up on a few <a href="http://www.parens-of-the-dead.com/">Parens of the Dead</a> episodes this weekend, I was
amused at how Magnar set up his Emacs to run tests whenever the file is saved.
At first I thought it wasn’t for me (I’m one of those who obsessively saves
every few seconds), but I’ve been trying it out lately and it’s starting to grow
on me.
</p>

<p>
At its core, all you really need is an hook. But I walked the extra yard and
wrote a minor mode for it, so I can easily call <kbd>M-x</kbd> <code>tdd-mode</code> to disable it
if it ever gets on my nerves.
</p>
{% highlight cl %}
(defun tdd-test ()
  "Thin wrapper around `cider-test-run-tests'."
  (when (cider-connected-p)
    (let ((cider-auto-select-test-report-buffer nil)
          (cider-test-show-report-on-success nil))
      (cider-test-run-ns-tests nil 'soft))))

(define-minor-mode tdd-mode
  "Run all tests whenever a file is loaded."
  nil nil nil
  :global t
  (if tdd-mode
      (add-hook 'cider-file-loaded-hook #'tdd-test)
    (remove-hook 'cider-file-loaded-hook #'tdd-test)))
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
I also had to change the <code>cider-test-success-face</code> to something a little less
“screamy”.
</p>
{% highlight cl %}
(custom-set-faces
 '(cider-test-success-face
   ((t (:foreground "green" :background nil)))))
{% endhighlight %}

<div id="outline-container-org770db58" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org770db58">Update <span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">21 nov 2015</span></span></h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org770db58">
<p>
Made it a global mode, so it’s easy to disable everywhere, and set the initial
value to <code>t</code>.
