Learning numeric prefixes is a vital step in the road to Emacs
mastery, and it's probably one of the editor's least appreciated
features. It took me more than a year to get the hang of doing
<kbd>C-3 C-k</kbd> instead of <kbd>C-a C-space C-n C-n
C-n C-w</kbd>.
</p>

<p>
Still, having three different ways of invoking this marvel is
one-too-many for my taste, specially when they take up premium
keyboard space. <kbd>M-9</kbd> isn't just a nice key, it's a
key I can hit while drunk in the dark and wearing boxing gloves &#x2014;it
deserves an equally important command.

<p>
Coincidentally, <a href="http://doc.endlessparentheses.com/Fun/backward-sexp"><code>backward-sexp</code></a> and <a href="http://doc.endlessparentheses.com/Fun/forward-sexp"><code>forward-sexp</code></a> are divine commands
with abhorrent default keybinds.
</p>
{% highlight cl %}
(global-set-key "\M-9" 'backward-sexp)
(global-set-key "\M-0" 'forward-sexp)
(global-set-key "\M-1" 'delete-other-windows)
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
<kbd>C-x 1</kbd> for <a href="http://doc.endlessparentheses.com/Fun/delete-other-windows"><code>delete-other-windows</code></a> isn't quite
abhorrent, but it also deserves better.</p>
