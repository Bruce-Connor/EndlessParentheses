<p>
Despite the majority of our cult opting to keep their
configs in version control, the best way I've found of
syncing my configuration throughout machines is to simply
link "~/.emacs.d" to "~/Dropbox/.emacs.d/". The only
downside are the packages that automatically add files to
the directory (abbrev, for instance). When you have two
emacs instances open on different computers trying to edit
the same file, it quickly leads to conflicts.

The logical solution is to make these files local.
