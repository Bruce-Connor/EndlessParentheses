<a href="http://doc.endlessparentheses.com/Fun/electric-indent-mode"><code>electric-indent-mode</code></a> is enough to keep your code nicely
aligned when all you do is type. However, once you start shifting
blocks around, transposing lines, or slurping and barfing sexps,
indentation is bound to go wrong.
</p>

<p>
Today’s lesson is <a href="http://emacs.stackexchange.com/a/385/50">my answer to mgoszcz2's question</a>. Having the perfect
auto-indent is easier than you might think. Copy this snippet to your
init file and you’ll <b>never</b> have unindented code again. 
</p>
{% highlight cl %}
(defun endless/indent-defun ()
  "Indent current defun."
  (interactive)
  (let ((l (save-excursion (beginning-of-defun 1) (point)))
        (r (save-excursion (end-of-defun 1) (point))))
    (indent-region l r)))

(defun endless/activate-aggressive-indent ()
  "Locally add `endless/indent-defun' to `post-command-hook'."
  (add-hook 'post-command-hook
            #'endless/indent-defun nil 'local))

(add-hook 'emacs-lisp-mode-hook
          #'endless/activate-aggressive-indent)
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
Evidently, this will activate on <code>emacs-lisp-mode</code>, but you can add
this last hook to any programming mode you use.
</p>

<p>
Here’s some code to try it on. After you’ve evaluated the above, open
a new <i>“.el”</i> file, paste the following code, and type something
before the opening parentheses.
</p>
{% highlight cl %}
(this is a
      test)
{% endhighlight %}
