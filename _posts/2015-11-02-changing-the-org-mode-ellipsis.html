<p>
The dot-dot-dot ellipsis that org-mode uses to indicate hidden content is
usually just fine. It’s only when you’re staring at a document where every line
is a folded headline, that you start to feel like they’re a little too much “in
your face”. I have a few org files with thousands of lines and hundreds of
headlines, and changing that <code>...</code> to something shorter greatly reduces visual
clutter.

<p>
The more straightforward option is to use a proper ellipsis character (the same
effect with a third the length).
</p>
{% highlight cl %}
(setq org-ellipsis "…")
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
The one I’m currently using is a cornered arrow.
</p>
{% highlight cl %}
(setq org-ellipsis "⤵")
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
Other interesting characters are <code>▼</code>, <code>↴</code>, <code>⬎</code>, <code>⤷</code>, and <code>⋱</code>.</p>
