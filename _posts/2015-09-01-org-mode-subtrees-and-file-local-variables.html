As you grow accustomed to fine-tuning your Emacs experience, it’s not unusual to
start using local variables in your files. These are specified as comment lines
at the end of the file, and are extremely practical in a number of scenarios. Here’s
a very simple org file.
</p>
{% highlight text %}
* Some headline
Ramblings no one cares about.
* Another headline
Thoughtfully rescinded.

# Local Variables:
# fill-column: 666
# End:
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
The only problem is that <code>org-mode</code> thinks that everything after a headline is
part of its contents, which is clearly not the case here. One example where this
is bad is when you want to shuffle the headlines around with <kbd>M-↓</kbd> or <kbd>M-↑</kbd>, and
you end up with something like this.
</p>
{% highlight text %}
* Another headline
Thoughtfully rescinded.

# Local Variables:
# fill-column: 666
# End:
* Some headline
Ramblings no one cares about.
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
I asked about that on <a href="http://emacs.stackexchange.com/q/2236/50">Emacs.StackExchange</a> and got a very simple solution: just
add a “dummy” level-1 headline before the local variable specification.
</p>
{% highlight text %}
* Some headline
Ramblings no one cares about.
* Another headline
Thoughtfully rescinded.

* COMMENT Footer 
# Local Variables:
# fill-column: 42
# End:
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
Now you can move, archive, and refile all your headlines as you wish, without
fear of destroying your precious variables. You can even <a href="/fine-tuning-subtree-visibility-in-org-mode.html">fine-tune the
visibility</a> to <code>folded</code>, so that the footer is always folded, and you won’t have
to see those variables at all.
</p>

<p>
But this wouldn’t be our weekly Endless Parentheses if I didn’t give you some
code to practice your elisp. The following command is just like <a href="https://doc.endlessparentheses.com/Fun/end-of-buffer"><code>end-of-buffer</code></a>,
except it places point before the footer. If invoked again, it will move to the
real end of buffer.
</p>
{% highlight cl %}
(defun endless/org-eob ()
  "Move to end of content, then end of buffer."
  (interactive)
  (unless (use-region-p)
    (push-mark))
  (if (looking-at-p "\n\\* COMMENT Footer")
      (goto-char (point-max))
    (goto-char (point-min))
    (if (search-forward "\n* COMMENT Footer"
                        nil 'noerror)
        (goto-char (match-beginning 0))
      (goto-char (point-max)))))
(define-key org-mode-map [remap end-of-buffer]
  #'endless/org-eob)
{% endhighlight %}
