<p>
The Multiple Cursors package has been given much praise throughout the
Emacsphere. It has a smaller use-case than keyboard macros, but it is usually
quicker and just plain looks awesome. To make full use of its commands, I
combine two of the concepts I've explained here before, <a href="/Meta-Binds-Part-1%253A-Drunk-in-the-Dark.html">rebinding <code>M-number</code></a> and
<a href="/the-toggle-map-and-wizardry.html">intuitive keymaps</a>.
</p>

<p>
I won’t go into what this package is, as Magnar already has <a href="http://emacsrocks.com/e13.html">a whole video on
that</a>. Instead, I’ll just explain how I use it.
</p>

<p>
Firstly, the following keys make the most sense to me.
</p>
{% highlight cl %}
(require 'multiple-cursors-core)
;; This is globally useful, so it goes under `C-x', and `m'
;; for "multiple-cursors" is easy to remember.
(define-key ctl-x-map "\C-m" #'mc/mark-all-dwim)
;; Usually, both `C-x C-m' and `C-x RET' invoke the
;; `mule-keymap', but that's a waste of keys. Here we put it
;; _just_ under `C-x RET'.
(define-key ctl-x-map (kbd "<return>") mule-keymap)

;; Remember `er/expand-region' is bound to M-2!
(global-set-key (kbd "M-3") #'mc/mark-next-like-this)
(global-set-key (kbd "M-4") #'mc/mark-previous-like-this)
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
These three commands do most of the hard work. I'll never forget about them, so
their keys don't need to be clever, they just need to be quick. Having
<code>mc/mark-next-like-this</code> <a href="/where-do-you-bind-expand-region-.html">right next to <code>er/expand-region</code></a> is really the best
place, although now-a-days I use <code>mc/mark-all-dwim</code> almost exclusively.
</p>

<p>
Something that took me a long time to figure out is that you can unmark stuff
you just marked. Previously, whenever I marked-next-like-this once too many I’d
just abort and start again. It makes sense to bind this to the same keys as
above with the <kbd>Shift</kbd> modifier.
</p>
{% highlight cl %}
;; These vary between keyboards. They're supposed to be
;; Shifted versions of the two above.
(global-set-key (kbd "M-£") #'mc/unmark-next-like-this)
(global-set-key (kbd "M-$") #'mc/unmark-previous-like-this)
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
On the other hand, this package has a myriad of commands which are extremely
useful on a less-than-daily basis, and this is where we invoke the power of
intuitive key-maps.
</p>
{% highlight cl %}
(define-prefix-command 'endless/mc-map)
;; C-x m is usually `compose-mail'. Bind it to something
;; else if you use this command.
(define-key ctl-x-map "m" 'endless/mc-map)

;;; Really really nice!
(define-key endless/mc-map "i" #'mc/insert-numbers)
(define-key endless/mc-map "h" #'mc-hide-unmatched-lines-mode)
(define-key endless/mc-map "a" #'mc/mark-all-like-this)

;;; Occasionally useful
(define-key endless/mc-map "d"
  #'mc/mark-all-symbols-like-this-in-defun)
(define-key endless/mc-map "r" #'mc/reverse-regions)
(define-key endless/mc-map "s" #'mc/sort-regions)
(define-key endless/mc-map "l" #'mc/edit-lines)
(define-key endless/mc-map "\C-a"
  #'mc/edit-beginnings-of-lines)
(define-key endless/mc-map "\C-e"
  #'mc/edit-ends-of-lines)
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
Note how easy these keys are to remember. I use <code>mc/insert-numbers</code> barely once
a week, but I never forget it's bound to <kbd>C-x m i</kbd> (and when I do use it, it’s a
godsend). Other commands that I rarely use but save me a lot of trouble when I
do are <code>sort/reverse-regions</code> and <code>mc-hide-unmatched-lines-mode</code>.
