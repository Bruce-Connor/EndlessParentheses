<p>
Emacs’ customizable variables (a.k.a., <code>defcustom</code>) are allowed to specify a
<code>:type</code> parameter for setting its custom-type. The customize interface uses this
information to produce a sophisticated menu for the user to customize that
variable. However, a large fraction of users use <code>setq</code> to directly edit custom
variables, and even some packages programmatically change the value of other
package’s custom variables. Ultimately, there are no guarantees that the value
in question matches the <code>:type</code> specified in the variable. 
</p>

<p>
<code>validate.el</code> tries to address that by offering a small set of functions and
macros to validate that a value matches a <code>:type</code> schema, throwing an error when
it doesn’t. Most importantly, in case of error it provides very informative
messages about what part of the value failed to validate. So, instead of getting
some obscure <code>wrong-type-argument</code> error deep down in the code, you’ll get a
message like the following as soon as the variable is used:
</p>

{% highlight text %}
Looking for ‘(repeat (choice string number))’ in ‘("aa" 90 la)’ failed because:
Looking for ‘(choice string number)’ in ‘la’ failed because:
  all of the options failed
    Looking for ‘string’ in ‘la’ failed because:
      not a string
    Looking for ‘number’ in ‘la’ failed because:
      not a number
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
There are 3 main use-cases for this:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li><p>
As an end-user of a package, you can use <code>validate-setq</code> instead of <code>setq</code>
for editing variables. This will ensure the configuration you provide matches
the schema specified by the developer, and thus prevents you from
misconfiguring stuff.
</p>

<p>
Also note that this works on any <code>defcustom</code> defined with a <code>:type</code>. That is,
it doesn’t matter if the package itself uses <code>validate.el</code>.
</p></li>
<li>As a developer, when using a variable, use <code>(validate-variable 'var-name)</code>.
This will be identical to just using <code>var-name</code> if the value passes
validation, but will immediately throw an error if it doesn’t.</li>
<li>Also as a developer, you can call <code>(validate-mark-safe-local 'var-name)</code>
which will create a safe-local predicate for the variable whenever the local
value satisfies its schema.</li>
</ol>

<p>
<code>validate.el</code> is available on <a href="https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/validate.html">GNU Elpa</a>, so you can install it from the
package-menu or add it as a dependency in your package.
