<p>
It’s difficult for me to spend much time interacting with a major-mode and not
find something to tweak. Even when that mode is my oldest companion in the world
of Emacs, something will surely pop up. So it’s only fitting that in the final
week of my thesis submission deadline I start tinkering with <code>latex-mode</code> again.
</p>

<p>
I wrote the following snippet after upgrading to the latest AucTeX from Gelpa,
which has a myriad of rules defined for <code>prettify-symbols-mode</code>. Equations
become much easier to read when you replace the verbose math symbols like
<code>\alpha</code> with <code>α</code>, but that only makes all the LaTeX styling commands stand out
even more. Suddenly, all those <code>\left</code>, <code>\right</code>, <code>\!</code> and <code>\;</code>, are sticking
out like that mole on a hag’s nose.
</p>

<p>
What do we do about that? We hide them away. Not completely, of course. We still
need to see those commands. We just tuck them away a little, where we <i>can</i> see
them without <i>having</i> to see them.
</p>
{% highlight cl %}
(defface endless/unimportant-latex-face
  '((t :height 0.6
       :inherit font-lock-comment-face))
  "Face used on less relevant math commands.")

(font-lock-add-keywords
 'latex-mode
 `((,(rx "\\" (or (any ",.!;")
                  (and (or "left" "right")
                       symbol-end)))
    0 'endless/unimportant-latex-face prepend))
 'end)
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
Here’s a sample of what it might look like for you.
