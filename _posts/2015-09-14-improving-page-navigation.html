If you’ve taken the time to browse some Elisp source files, you’ve no doubt run
into that odd little <code>^L</code>, a.k.a. the form feed character. Emacs uses these
white space characters as page delimiters. This makes for a very convenient way
to split a file into sections, and quickly navigate between them. I won’t go too
deep into them, as Eric James has already written a great <a href="http://ericjmritz.name/2015/08/29/using-page-breaks-in-gnu-emacs/">crash course on pages</a>
that you should go check out.
</p>

<p>
What I wanted to write about is the way that I do page navigation in Emacs.
Firstly, I find the default keys to be nothing short of abhorrent. Take a prefix
key with the <kbd>Control</kbd> modifier, attach to it a non-modified key, and then make that key
be something not-so-easy to hit, like <kbd>]</kbd>, and you have the recipe for painful
fingers.
</p>
{% highlight cl %}
(define-key prog-mode-map "\C-x\C-n" #'forward-page)
(define-key prog-mode-map "\C-x\C-p" #'backward-page)
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
These keys would normally be bound to <code>set-goal-column</code> and <code>mark-page</code>, which
I’ve never ever <i>ever</i> used (in fact, the former is disabled by default).
</p>

<p>
Then there’s a minor peeve. In some corner cases Emacs might leave the cursor at
the bottom of the screen after moving. Here we make sure that never happens.
</p>
{% highlight cl %}
;; Requires Emacs 24.5
(advice-add #'backward-page :after #'recenter)
(advice-add #'forward-page  :after #'recenter)
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
And then there’s the best part. It turns out you don’t need the form-feed
character to delimit pages. That’s important because some languages aren’t that
nice about them, and some dev teams might prefer you don’t stick those
<code>^L</code> all over the place. In Clojure, for instance, <code>cljfmt</code> confuses it for a
blank line and freaks out a little.
</p>

<p>
Fortunately, Elisp style already recommends using <code>;;;</code> to indicate comment
sections, and the form feed character is most commonly placed right above these
sections. So why not use that instead?
</p>
{% highlight cl %}
(setq page-delimiter
      (rx bol ";;;" (not (any "#")) (* not-newline) "\n"
          (* (* blank) (opt ";" (* not-newline)) "\n")))
;; Expanded regexp:
;; "^;;;[^#].*\n\\(?:[[:blank:]]*\\(?:;.*\\)?\n\\)*"
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
The regexp above is a bit special. We’re setting the page delimiter to be a
<code>;;;</code> at the start of a line, plus any number of empty lines or comment lines
that follow it (that <code>#</code> part is to exclude <code>;;;###autoload</code> cookies).
</p>

<p>
Consequently, when we hit <kbd>C-x C-n</kbd> or <kbd>C-x C-p</kbd>, the point is left right at the
start of the first code-line after the <code>;;;</code>. That’s usually where I want to be,
and it works even on buffers without <code>^L</code>, Clojure and Elisp. No doubt you can
extended that to your programming language of choice by replacing the semicolons
with the appropriate comment character.
</p>

<p>
Even better, why not write up a general solution based on the <a href="http://doc.endlessparentheses.com/Var/comment-start"><code>comment-start</code></a>
variable?
