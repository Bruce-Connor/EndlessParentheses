Did you know you can fetch <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a> pull requests with git by adding a
<code>remote.origin.fetch</code> configuration? That insightful tip is <a href="http://oremacs.com/2015/03/11/git-tricks/">a courtesy of</a> Oleh
at <a href="http://oremacs.com/">(or emacs</a>, a very active blog that has a habit of unbalancing parentheses
wherever it goes). I like the tip so much I wanted to add something to it.
Instead of manually adding that line to you <code>.git/config</code> file, why not have
Magit do that for you?
</p>

<p>
The following snippet will ensure that you always have this fetch configured on
Github repositories as soon as you issue <code>magit-status</code>.
</p>
{% highlight cl %}
(defun endless/add-PR-fetch ()
  "If refs/pull is not defined on a GH repo, define it."
  (let ((fetch-address
         "+refs/pull/*/head:refs/pull/origin/*"))
    (unless (member
             fetch-address
             (magit-get-all "remote" "origin" "fetch"))
      (when (string-match
             "github" (magit-get "remote" "origin" "url"))
        (magit-git-string
         "config" "--add" "remote.origin.fetch"
         fetch-address)))))

(add-hook 'magit-mode-hook #'endless/add-PR-fetch)
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
This means you can always access pull requests from Magit by hitting <kbd>b b</kbd>, the
usual branch command. The reference names start with <code>/refs/pull/origin/</code>, but
completion does most of the job here.
</p>

<p>
This is more lightweight approach than my <a href="/merging-github-pull-requests-from-emacs.html">previous post</a> on the subject, which
used <code>gh-pulls-mode</code>. You should try both and see which one you prefer.
</p>
