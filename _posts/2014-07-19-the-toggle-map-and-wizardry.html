I love intuitive keymaps. Some are so perfect, you just can’t avoid
mouthing the words every time you hit that blissful combo. A wizard
murmuring an incantation under his breath as his fingers draw the
arcane patterns.
</p>

<p>
The following keymap toggles some options which tend to be useful
throughout a session.
</p>
{% highlight cl %}
(define-prefix-command 'endless/toggle-map)
;; The manual recommends C-c for user keys, but C-x t is
;; always free, whereas C-c t is used by some modes.
(define-key ctl-x-map "t" 'endless/toggle-map)
(define-key endless/toggle-map "c" #'column-number-mode)
(define-key endless/toggle-map "d" #'toggle-debug-on-error)
(define-key endless/toggle-map "e" #'toggle-debug-on-error)
(define-key endless/toggle-map "f" #'auto-fill-mode)
(define-key endless/toggle-map "l" #'toggle-truncate-lines)
(define-key endless/toggle-map "q" #'toggle-debug-on-quit)
(define-key endless/toggle-map "t" #'endless/toggle-theme)
;;; Generalized version of `read-only-mode'.
(define-key endless/toggle-map "r" #'dired-toggle-read-only)
(autoload 'dired-toggle-read-only "dired" nil t)
(define-key endless/toggle-map "w" #'whitespace-mode)
{% endhighlight %}

There are eight keys being defined there, most of which aren’t even
used every day, but I know I’ll never forget a single one. That is the
beauty of mnemonics.
</p>

<p>
Doesn’t <i>“Emacs, toggle column”</i> just roll off your tongue as you’re
typing <kbd>C-x t c</kbd>? I feel like I’m commanding the
strands of reality, but that could just be my D&amp;D past taking the
better of me. 
</p>

<p>
<i>Also note: The manual recommends <kbd>C-c</kbd> for user keys, but I like using <kbd>C-x</kbd> for global keys and using <kbd>C-c</kbd> for mode-specific keys.</i></p>
