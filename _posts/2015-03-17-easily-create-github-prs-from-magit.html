<p>
In contrast with fetching pull requests, which either requires <a href="/merging-github-pull-requests-from-emacs.html">a minor-mode</a> or
some <a href="/automatically-configure-magit-to-access-github-prs.html">long-named branches</a>, <i>creating</i> pull requests is as easy as a one-key deal.
</p>

<p>
*If youâ€™re reading this now, note that this code was written for an older Magit
version. An up-to-date version of the code (working with latest Magit) can be
found on this <a href="/create-github-prs-from-emacs-with-magit.html">other post</a>.*

Because <a href="https://github.com/vermiculus/sx.el">sx.el</a> (a package which I really ought to blog about) was developed as a
group effort, <a href="https://github.com/vermiculus">Sean</a> and I decided early on to use PRs for everything.
Predictably, the need arose for a quick way to create them, and I promptly asked
<a href="http://emacs.stackexchange.com/q/3900/50">Emacs.StackExchange</a> for help. The solution below is a courtesy of <a href="http://emacs.stackexchange.com/users/2355/constantine">Constantine</a>.

{% highlight cl %}
(defun endless/visit-pull-request-url ()
  "Visit the current branch's PR on Github."
  (interactive)
  (browse-url
   (format "https://github.com/%s/pull/new/%s"
     (replace-regexp-in-string
      "\\`.+github\\.com:\\(.+\\)\\.git\\'" "\\1"
      (magit-get "remote"
                 (magit-get-current-remote)
                 "url"))
     (magit-get-current-branch))))

(eval-after-load 'magit
  '(define-key magit-mode-map "V"
     #'endless/visit-pull-request-url))
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
After hitting <kbd>V</kbd>, you just need to press the big green button at the Github
page.
