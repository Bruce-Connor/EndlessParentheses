<p>
Normally, <code>org-mode</code> ignores your attempts to markup text that starts with
    " or '. That’s probably a safe measure because <code>"~/"</code> is a very
    common string to write but <code>~</code> is one of Org’s markup elements.
</p>

<p>
Fixing that is a simple matter, but it takes a bit of digging around. We just
need to remove those two characters from the 3rd element of
<a href="https://doc.endlessparentheses.com/Var/org-emphasis-regexp-components"><code>org-emphasis-regexp-components</code></a>.

{% highlight cl %}
;; This HAS to come before (require 'org)
(setq org-emphasis-regexp-components
      '("     ('\"{“”"
        "-   .,!?;''“”\")}/\\“”"
        "    \r\n,"
        "."
        1))
{% endhighlight %}
