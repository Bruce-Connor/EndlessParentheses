<p>
As laptop touchpads seem to be steadily increasing in size, one unfortunate
consequence is that it becomes increasingly harder to avoid touching them by
accident while you type. Most systems have safeguards in place that disable the
touchpad as you‚Äôre typing, but they always seem to fall short for me when it
comes to Emacs. While in Emacs, my hands are permanently resting on the keyboard
(and over the touchpad), so even if I stop typing for several seconds I don‚Äôt
want the touchpad to reactivate.
</p>

<p>
There are ways to permanently deactivate the touchpad with a hotkey, but, so
far, the solution that best fits my use-style is to disable it only inside
Emacs.
</p>
{% highlight cl %}
(define-minor-mode disable-mouse-mode
  "A minor-mode that disables all mouse keybinds."
  :global t
  :lighter " üê≠"
  :keymap (make-sparse-keymap))

(dolist (type '(mouse down-mouse drag-mouse
                      double-mouse triple-mouse))
  (dolist (prefix '("" C- M- S- M-S- C-M- C-S- C-M-S-))
    ;; Yes, I actually HAD to go up to 7 here.
    (dotimes (n 7)
      (let ((k (format "%s%s-%s" prefix type n)))
        (define-key disable-mouse-mode-map
          (vector (intern k)) #'ignore)))))
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
All we do here is define a minor-mode that binds all mouse-related keys to
<code>ignore</code>. This is a slight improvement over the code on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4906534/disable-mouse-clicks-in-emacs/4906698#4906698">this StackOverflow
answer</a>. Of course, let‚Äôs not forget to enable this.

{% highlight cl %}
(disable-mouse-mode 1)
{% endhighlight %}

Two relevant limitations:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>This doesn‚Äôt distinguish between a touchpad an an actual mouse.</li>
<li>It is still possible for modes to define specific buttons that interact with
the mouse, but that‚Äôs not a huge problem because these buttons take a small
portion of the screen so it‚Äôs fairly difficult to touch them by accident.</li>
</ul>

By mere coincidence, it looks like Steve Purcell implemented something extremely
similar (comment below). Unlike me, he actually had the decency of wrapping the
minor-mode in a <a href="https://github.com/purcell/disable-mouse">Melpa package</a>, and I know some might prefer that over
lengthening their init file.
