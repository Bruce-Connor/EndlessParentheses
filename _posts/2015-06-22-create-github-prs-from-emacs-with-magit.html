<p>
I don’t usually dedicate an entire post to something I’ve already done in a
previous one, but this nugget is so useful it deserves the attention. Remember
how you can <a href="/easily-create-github-prs-from-magit.html">create Github PRs</a> straight from Magit? Magit <code>2.1.0</code> is barely <a href="https://twitter.com/magit_emacs/status/611204423906426880">two
weeks away</a>, and it brings so many (awesome) changes that our little snippet is
going to break.
</p>

<p>
Luckily for you, I’ve been using Magit’s next version for a couple of months
now, so I have a fix all shiny and ready for you. This function is also slightly
more robust, and fixes some corner-case issues in the other. So if you found
that the previous function didn’t cover your use-case, you should definitely try
the new one.
</p>
{% highlight cl %}
(defun endless/visit-pull-request-url ()
  "Visit the current branch's PR on Github."
  (interactive)
  (browse-url
   (format "https://github.com/%s/pull/new/%s"
     (replace-regexp-in-string
      "\\`.+github\\.com:\\(.+\\)\\.git\\'" "\\1"
      (magit-get "remote"
                 (magit-get-remote)
                 "url"))
     (cdr (magit-get-remote-branch)))))

(eval-after-load 'magit
  '(define-key magit-mode-map "v"
     #'endless/visit-pull-request-url))
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
Note that I’ve changed the keybind to <kbd>v</kbd>. In Magit <code>2.1</code>, that key is bound in
buffer overlays, not on the mode-map, which means we can just bind it in the map
and we’ll get a semi “do-what-I-mean” functionality.
