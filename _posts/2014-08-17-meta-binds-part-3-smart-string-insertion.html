Have you ever stopped to consider what is the string you type most
often?
</p>

<p>
In my case the answer is two-fold: <code>“~/”</code> and <code>“.emacs.d/”</code>.
Minibuffer completion helps, but we can always make things better.
The following snippet intelligently inserts both of these with a
single key, and it's smart enough to know which one you want.
</p>

<p>
Besides its use in writing configurations, it's great for going
straight to one of these directories inside the <a href="https://doc.endlessparentheses.com/Fun/find-file"><code>find-file</code></a> prompt.
</p>
{% highlight cl %}
(global-set-key (kbd "M-ç") #'endless/~-or-emacs.d)
(defun endless/~-or-emacs.d ()
  "Insert '~/', then '.emacs.d/'."
  (interactive)
  (if (looking-back "~/")
      (insert ".emacs.d/")
    (insert "~/")))
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
The <kbd>ç</kbd> key is right under my right pinky, but find
one that fits your need.
