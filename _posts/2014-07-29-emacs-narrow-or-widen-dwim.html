<p>
Narrowing is one of those features you won't even hear about in a more
mundane editor, but Emacs has an entire keymap for it. While I
wouldn't want to be without this feature, I'm all for simplification.

<p>
<a href="https://github.com/mwfogleman">Michael Fogleman</a> (the same justicier who took matters to his own hands
on <a href="/hungry-delete-mode.html">Hungry Delete Mode</a>) mentioned the following gem on the
<a href="/the-toggle-map-and-wizardry.html">The Toggle-Map and Wizardry</a> post. I took the liberty of adding a bit
of functionality.
</p>
{% highlight cl %}
(defun narrow-or-widen-dwim (p)
  "If the buffer is narrowed, it widens. Otherwise, it narrows intelligently.
Intelligently means: region, subtree, or defun, whichever applies
first.

With prefix P, don't widen, just narrow even if buffer is already
narrowed."
  (interactive "P")
  (declare (interactive-only))
  (cond ((and (buffer-narrowed-p) (not p)) (widen))
        ((region-active-p)
         (narrow-to-region (region-beginning) (region-end)))
        ((derived-mode-p 'org-mode) (org-narrow-to-subtree))
        (t (narrow-to-defun))))

(define-key endless/toggle-map "n" 'narrow-or-widen-dwim)
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
If you're the kind of person who knowns how to use <a href="http://doc.endlessparentheses.com/Fun/narrow-to-page"><code>narrow-to-page</code></a>,
this command might not be for you. Meanwhile, for us mortals, it more
than fits the bill.
