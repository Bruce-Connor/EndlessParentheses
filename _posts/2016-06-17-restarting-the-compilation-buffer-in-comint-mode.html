After <a href="/provide-input-to-the-compilation-buffer.html">last week's post</a>, Clément Pit-Claudel informed us of an alternative method
for providing input to compilations. I have no idea how I’d never learned about
that before, but I figure that other people might be in the same situation so
it’s worth a post. Have a look at the Update at the end of the post.

I’ve also updated an older post accordingly: <a href="/better-compile-command.html">Better compile command</a>.</p>
