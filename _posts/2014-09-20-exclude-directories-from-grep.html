<p>
I keep a couple of subdirectories inside my <i>“.emacs.d/”</i> for the
purpose of organization, so <a href="https://doc.endlessparentheses.com/Fun/rgrep"><code>rgrep</code></a>'ing is tremendously useful for
finding where a variable is being changed. By default, that will also
search inside <i>“elpa</i>”/, which slows the search and pollutes the
results page.
</p>

<p>
We can make grep more selective and, while we're at it, enable line
truncation.

{% highlight emacs-lisp %}
(eval-after-load 'grep
  '(progn
     (add-to-list 'grep-find-ignored-directories "tmp")
     (add-to-list 'grep-find-ignored-directories "node_modules")
     (add-to-list 'grep-find-ignored-directories ".bundle")
     (add-to-list 'grep-find-ignored-directories "auto")
     (add-to-list 'grep-find-ignored-directories "elpa")))
(setq wgrep-enable-key (kbd "C-c C-c"))
(add-hook 'grep-mode-hook (lambda () (toggle-truncate-lines 1)))
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
And don't forget to bind <kbd>rgrep</kbd> to your <a href="/launcher-keymap-for-standalone-features.html">Launcher Keymap</a>!
