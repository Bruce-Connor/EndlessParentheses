<p>
It doesn't take a psychic to guess the <code>kbd</code> tag will be useful when
writing about Emacs. When Jorge Navarro asked for the best way to do this, over
at <a href="http://emacs.stackexchange.com/q/2206/50">Emacs.SE</a>, I thought I'd share the snippet I use.
</p>

<p>
This simple command will ask for a key sequence (just like <kbd>C-h
k</kbd> would) and will insert it for you. If you want to write the sequence
manually, just hit <kbd>RET</kbd> when prompted. 
</p>
{% highlight cl %}
(define-key org-mode-map "\C-ck" #'endless/insert-key)
(defun endless/insert-key (key)
  "Ask for a key then insert its description.
Will work on both org-mode and any mode that accepts plain html."
  (interactive "kType key sequence: ")
  (let* ((is-org-mode (derived-mode-p 'org-mode))
         (tag (if is-org-mode
                  "@@html:<kbd>%s</kbd>@@"
                "<kbd>%s</kbd>")))
    (if (null (equal key ""))
        (insert
         (format tag (help-key-description key nil)))
      (insert (format tag ""))
      (forward-char (if is-org-mode -8 -6)))))
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
It should work in both <code>org-mode</code> and <code>markdown-mode</code>.
</p>
