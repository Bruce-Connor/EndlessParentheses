<p>
After the <a href="/implementing-comment-line.html">previous post</a>, I got in touch with the nice fellas at <a href="http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/">emacs-devel</a>
about <a href="http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2015-01/msg00884.html">including comment-line in Emacs</a>. Understandably, there was a wee bit of
concern with using up one of the oh-so-important <kbd>C-</kbd> binds, so it's been put
under <kbd>C-x C-;</kbd> for now.
</p>

<p>
On the bright side, the entire previous code-block gets replaced by a single
keybind.
