<b>Endless Parentheses</b> is a blog about <b>Emacs</b>. It features
 concise posts on improving your productivity and making
 Emacs life easier in general. Code included will be
 predominantly emacs-lisp, lying anywhere in the complexity
 spectrum with a blatant disregard for explanations or
 tutorials.
</p>

<p>
The outcome is that the posts read quickly and pleasantly
for experienced Emacsers, while new enthusiasts are invited
to digest the code and ask questions in the comments.
