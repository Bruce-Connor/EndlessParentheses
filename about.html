<b>Endless Parentheses</b> is a blog about <b>Emacs</b>. It features
 concise posts on improving your productivity and making
 Emacs life easier in general. 
</p>

<p>
Code included is predominantly emacs-lisp, lying
anywhere in the complexity spectrum with a blatant disregard
for explanations or tutorials.
The outcome is that the posts read quickly and pleasantly
for experienced Emacsers, while new enthusiasts are invited
to digest the code and ask questions in the comments.

can expect anything, from sophisticated functions to brief
comments on my keybind preferences.</li>
<li>Posts are usually short, 5-minute reads, as opposed to 20+-minute
investments. Don't expect huge tutorials.</li>
