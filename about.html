<b>Endless Parentheses</b> is a blog. Originally, it exclusively featured posts
about <b>Emacs</b>, mostly focused on improving your productivity and making Emacs
life easier in general.

Now, however, it has mutated into a blog about productivity in general. Emacs
still permeates my life (and will still show up here a lot), but I feel I have
more to talk about in other subjects and wonâ€™t be restricting myself to Emacs
anymore.
